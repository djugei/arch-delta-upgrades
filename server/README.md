# deltaserver
Generates deltas for clients to download.
Will cache deltas and packages a subfolder called deltaserver.

You probably will not have to run this yourself,
  and instead rely on a public instance.
Since generating deltas is a somewhat expensive process,
  there is no need to do it more than once globally.
